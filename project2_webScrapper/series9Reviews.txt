The watch function is ok but the wrist band is of a very poor design.   In the first couple of days that I wore the watch it spontaneously came off my wrist 2 times.  Once when I was simply sitting at the dinner table it caught on the edge of the table and released falling to the floor. Another time it spontaneously released when I was running a chain saw.  It fell down to black dirt. Read full review...

I love this thing! It keeps me connected when I can’t have my phone especially when I’m dancing or training in the gym.

i don't really care for the skinny band for the watch, i thought it would be the normal more thicker band

I like it for many reasons its very high tech and comfortable to wear as well.
